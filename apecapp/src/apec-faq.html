            },{
              q:"Is there any technology restriction?",
              a:"No, you can build with any technology that youâ€™re familiar with. However, submissions that can rapidly deploy and scale up will be given greater consideration. For this reason, products that effectively integrate with or are built on top of popular e-commerce platforms and tools may be preferred over products that attempt to \"reinvent the wheel.\""
            },{
              q:"Does my entry have to be a new app?",
              a:"Yes, you must build the app starting from the time you are confirmed as participants in this APEC App Challenge, not before. You may build the app on top of an existing, general platform or API, provided that your submission to the App Challenge provides novel and significantly different functionality than what is provided by the basic platform or API."
            },{
              q:"Why is this called an 'app challenge' instead of a 'hackathon'?",
              a:"Unlike a typical hackathon, we allow participants to start designing and building their app before coming to Malaysia, starting from the moment you are confirmed as participants. In Malaysia, we will have a hackathon-like overnight session with mentors on hand for you to finalize your product and prepare your pitch."
            },{
              q:"Are teams restricted to two members only?",
              a:"You can receive help from more than two persons while you are developing the app, but only two persons from each team can attend our final event. Others can support you remotely, but only these two teammates will be publicly listed as participants in the challenge and/or receive prize packages."
            },{
              q:"Is this event restricted to developers and designers only?",
              a:"If you wish, you may receive help from designers, marketers, or others while building your app. However, during the hackathon in Malaysia you will be finalizing the app, not building the idea, and so we suggest you only bring developers or designers who can actually work on finishing the app."
