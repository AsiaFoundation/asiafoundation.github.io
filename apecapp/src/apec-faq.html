Others can support you remotely, but only these two teammates will be publicly listed as participants in the challenge or receive prize packages."

              q:"Is this event restricted to developers and designers only?",
              a:"If you wish, you may receive help from designers, marketers, or others while building your app. However, during the hackathon in Hanoi you will be finalizing the app, not building the idea, and so we suggest you only bring developers or designers who can actually work on finishing the app."
