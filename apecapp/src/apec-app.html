            <h2>APEC App Challenge</h2>
            <p>Hanoi, Vietnam - May 18 and 19, 2017</p>
            <p id="overview">Some of the region’s most talented developer teams will be invited to take part in the APEC App Challenge: a competition with the aim of building an app to help micro and small businesses use the internet to export. The App Challenge is being supported by Google and The Asia Foundation and will occur on the sidelines of a major international trade meeting in Vietnam.</p>

              <h3>About</h3>

              <p>Micro, small and medium-sized enterprise (MSMEs) make up roughly 98% of all businesses in the Asia-Pacific and employ two thirds of the region’s labor force. The internet has dramatically cut the costs of exporting for MSMEs, and entrepreneurs are accessing new markets, integrating with global value chains, and growing their businesses in ways that create jobs and stimulate local economies.  However, many MSMEs still face significant challenges gaining access to new markets due to limited knowledge, market intelligence, and networks. For example, even though Indonesia’s small and medium enterprises contribute nearly 60% of GDP, their share of total exports is only 16%.</p>

              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <h4>Build an online tool, platform, or app to help MSMEs access new export markets.</h4>
              <p>Participants in this app challenge will create innovative apps and online platforms that have the potential to help MSMEs in APEC economies leverage the internet to begin exporting to foreign markets. Participants are encouraged to think creatively about the challenges faced by local MSMEs, the opportunities afforded by online tools and marketplaces, and the practicalities associated with developing and implementing their new product.</p>
              

              <p>Participants might address this challenge in some of the following ways:</p>
                
                <ol>
                <li>Standards and Regulatory Compliance</li>
                <li>Access to Financial Services</li>
                <li>Logistics and Supply Chain Management</li>
                <li>Building partner networks and gaining market intelligence</li>
                </ol>

              <p>Eligible teams must be nationals and/or residents of APEC economies. Teams must consist of two individuals, and team members may not be replaced after selection as finalists. All finalists are required to be in Hanoi for the App Challenge on May 18 and 19.</p>
