              <h3>About</h3>
              <h4>How can APEC‚Äôs software developers serve aging communities?</h4>
              <p>In 2017, about 10% of the population across APEC was aged 65 and above. This percentage will balloon to 25% by 2050. During APEC in 2020, many high-level discussions will take place concerning this trend, and ‚ÄúSmart Living for an Aging Population‚Äù has been highlighted as a priority area for policymakers and trade officials. As the 2020 APEC Host Economy, Malaysia aims to continue promoting efforts to leverage technology and policies to benefit the region‚Äôs growing number of seniors.</p>
              <p>The 2020 APEC App Challenge will require participants to use their software development and design skills to help older internet users search the web, communicate more effectively, and engage in commercial activity via the digital economy. The ‚Äúsilver economy‚Äù ‚Äì an expanding market for goods and services catering to the growing number of elderly across Asia ‚Äì presents opportunities for young innovators to develop exciting new digital products and services. Teams are encouraged to develop their own ideas and innovative solutions with an emphasis on creative, age-sensitive, mobile apps that are easy to understand and highly usable.  The team with the most compelling application will be awarded first prize and considered for additional support and recognition.</p>

              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <h4>Build products that help elderly internet users engage with the digital economy.</h4>
              <p>The 2020 APEC App Challenge will help elderly individuals better engage with the resources and opportunities of the digital economy by solving issues related to searching for and locating services, communicating with service providers, and buying and selling products. App Challenge participants will build new mobile and web tools that address these issues, using a range of different digital technologies.</p>

              <p>Developers who take on this challenge will craft solutions that address the following questions:</p>

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Search:</strong> How can local communities be made more accessible to older populations - such as locating services or specific types of shops using existing online resources?</li>
                <li><strong>Communication:</strong> How can communication and internet-enabled voice and video services be simplified to enable easier communication between the elderly and specific groups or individuals such as banks or service providers?</li>
                <li><strong>Commerce:</strong> Can internet-enabled tools be developed that help older people buy and sell products or services online in a way that is accessible to them?</li>
                </ol>

              <p>In addition, these solutions must be crafted in ways that address the broader challenges older people face when using internet-enabled mobile technologies. These challenges include maintaining safety and security online; providing age-sensitive UX and UI design; and bridging gaps that arise due to hearing impairment, vision loss, and other age-related issues.</p>

              <h3>Process</h3>

              <p>Eligible teams must be nationals and/or residents of APEC economies. Teams must consist of two individuals, and team members may not be replaced after selection as finalists. All finalists are required to be in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia for the App Challenge on April 18 and 19, 2020.</p>

              <p>Finalists will retain full ownership of the products they create during the App Challenge. However, under the terms of the challenge, APEC will have specified usage and branding rights.</p>

              <p>Participants do not need to define or build any part of their intended solution at the time of application. However, applicants will be evaluated based on their technical competence, understanding of the needs of elderly users, willingness and ability to take a product to market, and willingness to conduct independent user research and analysis.</p>

              <p>Detailed rules and requirements are posted <a href="">here</a>.</p>
