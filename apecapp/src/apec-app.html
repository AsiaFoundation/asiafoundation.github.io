              <h3>About</h3>
              <h4>How can APEC‚Äôs software developers serve aging communities?</h4>
              <p>In 2017, about 10% of the population across APEC was aged 65 and above. This percentage will increase to 25% by 2050. During APEC in 2020, many high-level discussions will take place concerning this trend, and ‚ÄúSmart Living for an Aging Population‚Äù has been highlighted as a priority area for policymakers and trade officials. As the 2020 APEC Host Economy, Malaysia aims to continue promoting and mainstreaming efforts across different APEC fora to leverage technology and policies that benefit the region‚Äôs growing senior community.</p>
              <p>The 2020 APEC App Challenge will require participants to use their software development and design skills to seek technology solutions that fit within the APEC Malaysia 2020 theme and its priorities. The ‚Äúsilver economy‚Äù ‚Äì an expanding market for goods and services catering to the growing number of elderly across Asia ‚Äì presents opportunities for young innovators to develop exciting new digital products and services. Teams are encouraged to develop their own ideas and innovative solutions with an emphasis on creative, age-sensitive, mobile apps that are easy to understand and highly usable. The team with the most compelling application will be awarded first prize and considered for additional support and recognition.</p>

              <h3>Challenge</h3>
              <h4>Build products that help elderly people live healthier and more productive lives</h4>
              <p>The 2020 APEC App Challenge will help empower the aging society, enrich their lives, and promote their general wellbeing. App Challenge participants will build new mobile and web tools that address these issues, using a range of different digital technologies.</p>

              <p>Developers who take on this challenge will craft solutions that address the following questions:</p>

                <ol>
                <li><strong>Health and independence:</strong> How can mobile apps promote the health and independence of elderly populations?</li>
                <li><strong>Productivity:</strong> How can mobile apps help engage the elderly in activities that contribute to the economy?</li>
                </ol>

              <p>In addition, these solutions must be crafted in ways that address the challenges older people face when using internet-enabled mobile technologies. These challenges include addressing a lack of digital literacy; maintaining a high degree of online safety and security; addressing user experience issues such as a lack of familiarity with modern UI/UX design and gesture-based interactions; and bridging gaps that arise due to hearing impairment, vision loss, and other age-related issues.</p>

              <h3>Process</h3>

              <p>Eligible teams must be nationals and/or residents of APEC economies. Teams must consist of two individuals, and team members may not be replaced after selection as finalists. All finalists are required to be in Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia for the App Challenge on April 18 and 19, 2020.</p>

              <p>Finalists will retain full ownership of the products they create during the App Challenge. However, under the terms of the challenge, APEC will have specified usage and branding rights.</p>

              <p>Participants do not need to define or build any part of their intended solution at the time of application. However, applicants will be evaluated based on their technical competence, understanding of the needs of elderly users, willingness and ability to take a product to market, and willingness to conduct independent user research and analysis.</p>

              <p>Detailed rules and requirements are posted <a href="https://asiafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-APEC-App-Challenge-Rules-and-Requirements.pdf">here</a>.</p>
