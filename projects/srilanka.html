            <p>The e-Citizen Report Card (eCRC) is helping build a smarter and more responsible government in Sri Lanka. By making it easy to collect and analyze anonymous citizen feedback, eCRCs help local authorities measure the quality of government services through the eyes of the citizens who need them most.</p>
            <p>Using the Android-based mobile eCRC app, survey enumerators can collect citizen input on services ranging from waste collection to water to the quality of local libraries. Integration with an online database makes it possible to process these data in real time, and an online dashboard automatically generates simple visuals that convey the findings.</p>
            <p>Within two years of the project's inception, eCRC survey enumerators had visited over 13,000 households in five of Sri Lanka's provinces, and the tool has been welcomed as a crucial addition to local participatory planning and budgeting processes. In fact, while local authorities are free to use the eCRC data as they please, nearly all choose to publish the data - even the most negative findings. This approach helps local leaders better understand the needs of citizens, and supports a broader dialogue with the community on social accountability.</p>
