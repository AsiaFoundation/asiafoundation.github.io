            <strong>Mapping Ulaanbaatar</strong>
            <p>Three quarters of a million nomads from across Mongolia inhabit Ulaanbaatar’s “Ger Areas” – a ring of low-income neighborhoods that form one of the largest unplanned settlements in Asia. Some of these areas are so new they aren’t even on a map, while satellite imagery accessible to the city is often of a low resolution or obscured by cloud cover. Without good geospatial data, planning for the delivery of basic services is nearly impossible, and many neighborhoods have no available water, sewage, or medical facilities.</p>
            <p>Working with the City of Ulaanbaatar, The Asia Foundation collected high-quality imagery and elevation data for the city using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and earth-imaging satellites. These high-resolution images were used to create detailed maps complete with elevation data, and labeled neighborhoods, roads, buildings, landmarks, and other features. And in a bid to make this information open and accessible to all, the maps were shared with <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a>, a world-wide, community-driven mapping project.</p>
