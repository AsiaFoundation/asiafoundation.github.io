            <strong>SafetiPin</strong>
            <p><a href="http://safetipin.org">SafetiPin</a> is a free Android and iOS app that employs location services and an open-source map to allow users to rate a neighborhood or a specific street’s relative safety, while also showing how others have rated that area. To augment data submitted by users, The Asia Foundation worked with SafetiPin to provide professionally trained auditors to collect additional safety-related information on communities and cities. By leveraging the crowd, SafetiPin is taking a bottom-up approach to addressing a serious challenge faced by many local governments in Asia: providing citizens with safe and secure public spaces.</p>
            <p>At the core of the app is the Safety Audit. Users rate the safety of a given area based on key parameters such as the availability of working street lights, the presence of police and other security personnel, the number of men or women on the street, and the overall mood on the street. User data is aggregated by SafetiPin and fed back to the appropriate government agencies to advocate for better infrastructure and policy change.</p>
