            <strong>Title</strong>
            <p>Lured by higher wages in the Gulf Countries and East Asia, over three million Nepalis have taken temporary jobs abroad. Cut off from their families and support networks, these migrants often face rights abuses, exploitation, human trafficking, and financial distress. </p>
            <p>The Asia Foundation's Safe Migration App, called <i>Shuvayatra</i> ("Safe Travels"), offers access to local networks and multimedia content that directly addresses these problems in new and meaningful ways. Through the app, users can access relevant, local-language content developed specifically for Nepali migrants, including extensive written materials, audio content and podcasts, and links to social media platforms. This content is carefully curated for individuals who are either preparing to travel for work or who have already migrated, as well as social media features that migrants can use to share ideas and content online.</p>
            <p>The app is backed by The Asia Foundation's years of research into the needs of Nepali migrant workers as well as the deep experience of our local partners, including the <a href="http://nrna.org.np/">Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA)</a> - the largest and most prominent network of Nepalis living abroad. Through this partnership, we seek to connect migrant workers to the global Nepali diaspora, and to bring their knowledge to bear on the problems faced by migrants all over the world.</p>
