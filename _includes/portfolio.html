            <strong>Yangon, Myanmar</strong>
            <p>In the run-up to Myanmar’s historic 2015 election, the Foundation and local partners worked together to create the only consistently available and reliable source of candidate information: the <a href="http://maepaysoh.org">Mae Pay Soh (“Let’s Vote”)</a> voter information database. The database and its related application programming interface (API), gave software developers direct access to a suite of official information collected and verified by the Myanmar Union Election Commission, including official data on the nearly 6000 candidates and 90+ political parties contesting the election.</p>
            <p>This resource proved invaluable to the country’s emerging civic tech community, especially during the groundbreaking “Mae Pay Soh Hack Challenge,” a two-week programming competition organized by The Asia Foundation to create election-related mobile and web applications. More than 130 developers and designers in 30 teams entered the competition and 31 different web and mobile applications were submitted to the judges, making it Myanmar’s largest programming competition to date. Ten of the most polished applications were made available for free online and in the Google Play and iOS app stores, where they have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times already.</p>
